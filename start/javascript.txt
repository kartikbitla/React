JAVASCRIPT REFRESHER

javascript can be executed in many environments
1. In the Browser - Javascript code can be included in any website. The code then executes inside the browser (i.e on the machine of the website visitor).
2. On any Computer - Thanks to node.js or Deno javascript code can be executed outside of the browser too. The code then executes directly on the machine.
3. On mobile Devices - With extra technologies like capacitor or react native, you can build mobile apps based on javacript. The code then executes on the mobile device.


<script src='index.js' defer></script>
    - Here the defer keyword wroks when we are importing our js file in the head tag, it will let the html code run first and if anything
    is depended on the html code it will be managed by that. Suppose some li tags are has a attachment with the js code it will directly
    without including the js file. to prevent this we need to mention that in the script tag. 

    or the other way is to mention script tag to the end of the <body> section.
