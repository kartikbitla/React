    React - Declarative
      - Define the goal, not the steps
      
      
      let content;
      if(user.isLoggedIn){
         content = <button>Continue</button>
      }else{
         content = <button>Log In</button>
      }

      return content;




   JS - Imperative
      - Define the steps, not the goal
      let btn = document.querySelector('button);
      if(user.isLoggedIn){
         button.textContent = 'Continue;
      }else{
         button.textContent = 'Log In';
      }

      document.body.append(btn);



Name Starts with uppercase character
 - The function name must start with an uppercase character. Multi-word names should be written in PascalCase (e.g., "MyHeader")
   It's recommended to pick a name that describes the UI building block (e.g., "Header" or "MyHeader")


Returns "Rederable" content
 - The function must return a value that can ne rendered ("displayed on screen") by React.
   In most cases: return JSX also allowed: string, number, boolean, null, array of allowed values.
